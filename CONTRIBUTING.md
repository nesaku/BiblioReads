## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[BiblioReads Code of Conduct](https://github.com/BiblioReads/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to admin@nesaku.eu.org.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the [README](https://github.com/nesaku/biblioreads#readme).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [issues](https://github.com/nesaku/biblioreads/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/nesaku/biblioreads/issues/new).
- Follow the issue template and add any relevant details.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version (this can be checked by comparing your version with the latest version in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/nesaku/BiblioReads/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#changelog)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report or issue existing for your bug.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - OS, Browser and Version
  - Console logs
  - Screenshots
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

Security bugs may be sent by email to admin@nesaku.eu.org with the text SECURITY in the subject or by using the "Report a security vulnerability" option in the [new issues](https://github.com/nesaku/BiblioReads/issues/new/choose) section.

We use GitHub and Codeberg issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/nesaku/biblioreads/issues/new) using the "Bug Report" template.
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The team member will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `bug`, and the issue will be fixed.

### Suggesting Enhancements (Feature Requests)

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for BiblioReads, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/nesaku/biblioreads#readme) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/nesaku/biblioreads/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. If you're not sure about the scope or aim of your enhancement, create an issue and it will be dealt with later.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nesaku/biblioreads/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most BiblioReads users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
